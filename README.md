# PowerSystems - Ceraolo's fork

A few words about the rationale of this fork. As a professor of Electric power Systems and a heavy Modelica user, I consider Power System Library a very important achievement of the Modelica community. However, personally I've had several problems in understanding how to use this library, and I think that also other users may encounter similar problems.

My the difficulties in understanding this library were due to both the documentation (that I consider too short) and the library whose structure and organization, in my opinion, can be improved.

Therefore I consider this fork as a lab to test my ideas and what I think are improvements. I will continue to contribute to the "official" Power Systems Library with tichets and comments to tickets.
